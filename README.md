## About The Project

This project is part of Turing Software and Design's Front-End Program, Module 2. The project focused on building an application using test-driven-development (TDD) every step of the way. The program was implemented with ES6 syntax and exclusively uses array-prototype methods whenever iterations need to be performed. There are no for loops used in the program. Four distince databases were originally supplied, each representing large chunks of data for 50 randomly generated "users". Our task was to create several objects containing methods which would dynamically display a given users' data on the DOM when selected.
